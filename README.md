# Data-Analysis-Summer Analytics 
Data Analysis in Jupyter notebook using pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and visualizing it using Machine Learning algorithms in Python.

#Pandas-Basics
Hey, excited?
Welcome to Summer Analytics 2022.
We'll start this amazing journey by peeking into basics of Python.

#Numpy-Basics
Let's look into Numpy, the scientific computing library of Python. It will save you from doing heavy mathematical calculations. Also, let's get a brief overview of Pandas.

#Pandas-Basics
Missing values, outlier data can trouble you. Let us introduce Pandas-the most famous data manipulation library in python.

#MatplotLib-Basics and Seaborn-Basics
Data visualization gives us a clear idea of what the information means by giving it visual context through maps or graphs. Matplotlib and Seaborn are widely used for Data Visualization. Let's Explore!

#Statiscal-Basics
Dealing with large tables of data can be overwhelming! Just observing the rows of tables won't lead us anywhere. But fortunately we can smartly summarize data via "Number Summaries" (a.k.a. Descriptive Statistics)
